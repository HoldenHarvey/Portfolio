# Holden Harvey's Portfolio

## Description
this portfolio was designed by me, Holden Harvey, to show off my web development accomplishments and achievements. As my portfolio expands, I can add to it and update it to show my work. Whilst working on this project, i learned more about flex, parent and child elements, and many other important aspects of HTML and CSS.
